Tower games
             Towers of Reus Project
• Towers of Reus is a tower defense game project that gives a
  demonstration of how Genetic Algorithms (GA) can be used to
  balance game play.
• Users can use the map editor packaged with the game to create
  their maps where they have the option of adjusting game balancing
  parameters.
• Then user can load the level into the game and let the GA
  component run it until it has the most optimal winning solution.
• The user can then see if certain towers are too strong or too weak,
  or even if the level is able to be beaten.
• Then the user has the option of playing the game themselves to see
  if they have the skills to win!

     What is Genetic Algorithms?
• Genetic algorithms (GA) are one specific
  method of evolutionary computing.

• Evolutionary computing has been used in
  engineering, particularly in optimization, to
  solve computationally hard problems.

• Genetic algorithm (GA) introduces the principle of
  evolution
  and genetics into search among possible solutions
  to given problem.

• The idea is to simulate the process in natural systems.

• This is done by the creation within a machine of a
  population of individuals represented by chromosomes,
  in essence a set of character strings,that are analogous to
  the DNA,that we have in our own chromosomes.
                                                                21

• Directed search algorithms based on the
  mechanics of biological evolution

• Developed by John Holland, University of
  Michigan (1970’s)
  – To understand the adaptive processes of natural
    systems
  – To design artificial systems software that retains
    the robustness of natural systems

         Survival of the Fittest
• The main principle of evolution used in GA
  is “survival of the fittest”.
• The good solution survive, while bad ones die.

                 Crossover
• Crossover is concept from genetics.
• Crossover is sexual reproduction.
• Crossover combines genetic material from two
  parents, in order to produce superior offspring.
• Few types of crossover:
  – One-point
  – Multiple point.
  – Many more (next chapter)

         About Probabilities...
• Average probability for individual to
  crossover is, in most cases, about 80%.
• Average probability for individual to mutate

  is about 1-2%.
• Probability of genetic operators
  follow the probability in natural systems.
• The better solutions reproduce more often.
             Fitness Function

• Fitness function is evaluation function, that
  determines what solutions are better than others.
• Fitness is computed for each individual.
• Fitness function is application depended.
                                Selection
• The selection operation copies a single individual,
  probabilistically selected based on fitness, into the
  next generation of the population.

• There are few possible ways to implement
  selection:
   – “Only the strongest survive”
       • Choose the individuals with the highest fitness for next generation
   – “Some weak solutions survive”
       • Assign a probability that a particular individual will be selected for the next
         generation
       • More diversity
       • Some bad solutions might have good parts!

                  Stopping Criteria
• Final problem is to decide
  when to stop execution of algorithm.

• There are two possible solutions to this problem:
  – First approach:
      • Stop after production of definite number of generations
  – Second approach:
      • Stop when the improvement in average fitness over two generations is
         below a threshold

Human work      Minimal                     Long and exhaustive

                                      There are problems
Applicability   General               that cannot be solved analytically

Performance     Excellent                        Depends




                                                          * Not necessary!
          Problems With Gas
• Sometimes GA is extremely slow, and much
  slower than usual algorithms
                 Advantages of Gas
• Concept is easy to understand.
• Minimum human involvement.
• Computer is not learned how to use existing solution,
  but to find new solution!
• Modular, separate from application
• Supports multi-objective optimization
• Good for “noisy” environments
• Always an answer; answer gets better with time !!!
• Inherently parallel; easily distributed
• Many ways to speed up and improve a GA-based application as knowledge
  about problem domain is gained
• Easy to exploit previous or alternate solutions
              When to Use a GA
• Alternate solutions are too slow or overly complicated
• Need an exploratory tool to examine new approaches
• Problem is similar to one that has already been
  successfully solved by using a GA
• Want to hybridize with an existing solution
• Benefits of the GA technology meet key problem
  requirements
