• Taking partial / alela sequence
  fragments of DNA genome to be
  incorporated into the offspring

• Crossover operator in GA represent
  what happens in the real world

⚫ Many methods have been proposed
⚫ Each method has speciﬁc
  characteristics and may be only be
  used on certain types of
  representation. For example, cross

  is speciﬁc to the problem in
  permutation.

Crossover For Real Representation

        We can understand that the three methods Cross over in previous slide can be used for binary and
        integer representation.



        This is due to both representations have the values of the genes in a finite interval. The values of the
        genes in the binary representation is 0 or 1.



        On the representation of integers, may be there is little variation in the value for each gene. For
        example, integer representation used to represent real numbers only have 10 possible values for each
        genes.



        What if each gene may have a value that has real representation? For a real representation, cross over
        can be done in two ways: discrete and intermediate
Crossover For Real Representation: Discrete


            The methods to select position of genes is Cross over multi points
            or Cross over uniform.



            Each gene in offspring z derived from one parent (x, y) with equal
            probability, zi = xi or yi.

                Single arithmetic crossover
             Suppose two parent of chromosomes expressed as:




Select 1 gen randomly, for example k. Then, both the child will be produced by:

    Crossover For Permutation Representation
• Cross over to permutation representation will be used to solve
  permutation problem, for example Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

• In TSP, permutation representation using gen position as the order of
  the city. Cross over to binary representation, integer representation
  and real representation can not be used for this representation.

• Why not?

Permutation Representation: Order crossover


                                           Choose 2 cut points
   Observes that order is
      important, not
    necessarily position.

                                  Copy between cut points to offspring

       How it works:

                                Starting from 2nd cut point in one parent,
                                 fill missing cities in order they appear in
                                               another parent

Partially mapped crossover

Portion of one parent is mapped to a portion of another parent


Remaining info is exchanged


How it works:

1. Choose two random cut points
2. Define mapping
3. Copy mapping section (between cut points) to offspring
4. Fill in remainder of offspring using mapping

Cycle crossover
• Creates an offspring where every position is occupied by a corresponding
  element from one of the parents using two cycles, crossed and the direction
  alternately.

• The Cycle Crossover operator identifies a number of so-called cycles between two
  parent chromosomes. Then, to form Child 1, cycle one is copied from parent 1,
  cycle 2 from parent 2, cycle 3 from parent 1, and so on.
Cycle crossover
Edge Crossover
• Creates a path (offspring) that is similar to a set of existing paths (parents) by
  looking at the edges rather than the vertices.
• Edge Map
   • For each node, gives list of other nodes to which it has an edge in either parent
