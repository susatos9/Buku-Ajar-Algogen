How to solve problem using GA ?
• Generate Population ..done
• Encoding → Chromosome…done
• Define Fitness Function …done
• Define GA Operator
  • Selection
  • Cross Over
  • Mutation
Selection
 • During each successive generation, a proportion of the existing population
   is selected to breed a new generation.

 • Individual solutions are selected through a fitness-based process, where
   fitter solutions (as measured by a fitness function) are typically more likely
   to be selected.

 • There some of Methods that can be used :
    • Fitness Proportionate Selection (FPS)
         • Roulette wheel
         • Baker’s SUS (Stochastic Universal Sampling)
    • Rank-Based Selection
         • Linear Ranking
         • Non-linear ranking
    • Tournament Selection
FPS: Roulette Wheel


• The simplest selection scheme is roulette-wheel selection, also called stochastic sampling with
  replacement.

• This is a stochastic algorithm and involves the following technique:
    • The individuals are mapped to contiguous segments of a line, such that each individual's
      segment is equal in size to its fitness.
    • A random number is generated and the individual whose segment spans the random
      number is selected.
    • The process is repeated until the desired number of individuals is obtained (called mating
      population).

• This technique is analogous to a roulette wheel with each slice proportional in size to the fitness.

kromosom
K1         2/8 = ¼ = 0,25
K2         1/8 = 0,125
K3         1/8 = 0,125
K4         4/8 = 0,5
Total      1
Example (FPS: RW)
   Table shows the selection probability for 11 individuals. Individual 1 is the most fit individual and occupies
   the largest interval, whereas individual 10 as the second least fit individual has the smallest interval on the
   line. Individual 11, the least fit interval, has a fitness value of 0 and get no chance for reproduction




The roulette-wheel selection algorithm provides a zero bias but does not guarantee minimum spread.
FPS: Baker’s SUS (Stochastic Universal
Sampling)
• Stochastic universal sampling[Bak87] provides zero
  bias and minimum spread.

• The individuals are mapped to contiguous segments of
  a line, such that each individual's segment is equal in
  size to its fitness exactly as in roulette-wheel selection.

• Here equally spaced pointers are placed over the line
  as many as there are individuals to be selected.
                                                           [Bak87] Baker, J. E.: Reducing Bias and Inefficiency in the Selection Algorithm. In [ICGA2], pp. 14-21, 1987.
• Consider NPointer the number of individuals to be
  selected, then the distance between the pointers are
  1/NPointer and the position of the first pointer is given
  by a randomly generated number in the range [0,
  1/NPointer].
Example (FPS: B’SUS)
      Tournament Selection
 • In tournament selection, a number Tour of individuals is chosen randomly from the population
   and the best individual from this group is selected as parent.
 • This process is repeated as often as individuals must be chosen.
 • These selected parents produce uniform at random offspring.
 • The parameter for tournament selection is the tournament size Tour.
 • Tour takes values ranging from 2 to Nind (number of individuals in population).
 • Relation between tournament size and selection intensity:
                Tournament Size                       1          2          3           5          10           30
