• How to Generate Population
• Encoding
  -Encoding -
Genetic Algorithm
Solving problem using GA

•Create encoding design:
           Individu → Chromosome

•Formulate fitness function

•Define GA operators
Encoding individu → chromosome
•An individual is encoding into a chromosome through
 appropriate method.

•Four encoding types:
  •Binary
  •Integer
  •Real
  •Permutation
Encoding

⦿ Marek Obitko (1998) have different classification of encoding
  methods. He divide encoding methods into four groups, i.e:

     ⦿ Binary Encoding (Pengkodean biner)

     ⦿ Permutation Encoding

     ⦿ Value Encoding

     ⦿ Tree Encoding
Efﬁcient Encoding

• Complete
   • if every point in the search space can be coded
• Closed
   • if all individuals produced by the application of genetic operators can be coded to
     a valid phenotype.
• Proximity
   • If used encoding methods can increase slowly the parameters are guaranteed
• Short Scheme
   • If the parameters of the similar problem are also encoded in similar genotype
Kriteria… (cont.)

• Kemampuan
   • Jika panjang genotype adalah minimum
• Von-Isomorphism
   • Jika setiap genotype merepresentasikan genotype solusi yang unik
• Modularitas
   • Ketika solusi parsial (model/blok bangunan) ditulis hanya sekali & suatu
     mekanisme tersedia sehingga mereka dapat didefinisikan untuk sembarang titik
     dalam pengkodean
Binary Encoding

• The most common encoding

• First used in genetic algorithms by Holland

• Each chromosome is expressed in rows of bits 0 or 1

• Examples of chromosomes with binary coding
Binary Encoding (cont.)
• There are many possibilities for chromosomes even with a small
  number of alleles, i.e. 0 or 1

• Suitable problem: Knapsack problem




• Disadvantage: often not suitable for many problems and the correction
  process must be carried out after the evolution process (crossover and /
  mutation)
       Permutation Encoding

• Can be used in ordering problems (ordering problem)


• Each chromosome is a sequence of numbers stating the numbers in
a sequence

• Only useful for sorting problems, for example: trading, Routes, etc.


• Example:
          Value Encoding

• Can be used for problems that have complicated values

• Each chromosome is a sequence of values, where the value can be
  anything related to the problem

• It is suitable for certain problems, for example looking for weights on NN

• Example:
                             Tree Encoding
• Widely used to compile programs /
  expressions in genetic programming
• Each chromosome is a tree of
  several objects, such as functions or
  commands in the programming
  language

• Example problem: lookup a value
  function based on a given value
• Example:
FITNESS FUNCTION
solving problem using GA

• Create encoding design:
              Individu → Chromosome

• Formulate fitness function

• Define GA operators
Fitness Function

• Genetic Algorithms are defined as a machine learning model that
  decreases all evolutionary behavior in nature from a population
  abstracting the solution to an optimization problem that is selected,
  crossover and mutated according to its relative fitness value.
• Evolution function, expresses the performance of a genome to a
  population
• Fitness function is the performance influenced by other genomes and
  objective function that describes the optimization problem
• Fitness function = fi / f
   • fi: function / evaluation value of genome-i
   • f: average evaluation value in a population
       Example 1
• Knapsack problem

Quiz-4

A wood craftsman wants to make a tube-shaped decoration without a lid.
The tube is expected to hold a liquid of not less than 200. Help the
craftsman to design the tube with minimal materials.

Formulate the problem then how is the coding and the fitness function!
