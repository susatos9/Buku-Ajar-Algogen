\chapter{Crossover (Recombination) in Genetic Algorithms}

\section{Introduction to Crossover}
Crossover, also known as recombination, is the primary genetic operator in genetic algorithms~\cite{holland1975adaptation, goldberg1989genetic, mitchell1996introduction}. It combines genetic material from two or more parent solutions to create offspring, potentially inheriting beneficial traits from multiple parents. Crossover exploits existing solutions to explore new regions of the search space.

\section{Biological Inspiration}
In nature, sexual reproduction combines genetic material from two parents:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Crossing over}: Exchange of genetic segments between homologous chromosomes
    \item \textbf{Independent assortment}: Random distribution of chromosomes
    \item \textbf{Genetic diversity}: Offspring differ from parents
    \item \textbf{Building blocks}: Beneficial gene combinations are preserved and mixed
\end{itemize}

\section{Crossover Principles}

\subsection{Exploration vs. Exploitation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exploitation}: Combines good building blocks from parents
    \item \textbf{Exploration}: Creates new combinations not present in parents
    \item \textbf{Heritability}: Offspring resemble parents but with variations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Crossover Probability}
Crossover is typically applied with probability $p_c$ (usually 0.6-0.9):
\begin{itemize}
    \item High $p_c$: More exploration, faster convergence
    \item Low $p_c$: More exploitation of current solutions
    \item $p_c = 1.0$: Always apply crossover
    \item $p_c = 0.0$: No crossover (mutation-only evolution)
\end{itemize}

\section{Binary Crossover Operators}

\subsection{Definition and Function of Crossover Operator}
Crossover is a genetic operator used to vary the arrangement of chromosomes from one generation to the next~\cite{geeksforgeeks_crossover, tutorialspoint_crossover, course_week4_crossover}. The crossover method used depends on the encoding method applied.

Crossover occurs in three stages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The reproduction operator randomly selects a pair of individual strings for the mating process.
    \item A cross site is randomly selected along the length of the string.
    \item The values after the cross site are exchanged between the two strings to form new offspring.
\end{enumerate}

In binary chromosome representation, each individual in the population is represented as a sequence of bits (0 and 1) that express a potential solution to a problem.

\subsection{One-Point Crossover}
Single-point crossover is the simplest form of crossover. One crossover position is randomly selected, then the part of the two parents after that position is exchanged to form two new offspring. The strings resulting from this process have Positional Bias characteristics.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/buku_ajar_page_24.png}
\caption{Single-Point Crossover for binary chromosomes}
\label{fig:binary_single_point}
\end{figure}

\subsection{One-Point Crossover}
Single crossover point divides chromosomes into two segments.

\subsubsection{Algorithm}
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{One-Point Crossover}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE Select random crossover point $k \in [1, l-1]$
\STATE Create offspring:
\STATE $child_1 = parent_1[1:k] + parent_2[k+1:l]$
\STATE $child_2 = parent_2[1:k] + parent_1[k+1:l]$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Example}
\begin{align}
\text{Parent 1:} &\quad 1|1010011 \\
\text{Parent 2:} &\quad 0|0111100 \\
\text{Child 1:} &\quad 1|0111100 \\
\text{Child 2:} &\quad 0|1010011
\end{align}

Crossover point at position 1.

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simple and efficient
    \item Preserves long building blocks near chromosome ends
    \item May disrupt building blocks crossing the crossover point
    \item Positional bias (end positions less likely to be separated)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Two-Point Crossover}
Two crossover points create three segments.

Multi-point crossover has a mechanism like single-point crossover; the difference is the number of randomly selected positions. In Multi-point crossover, a number N of positions are randomly selected along the length of the chromosome. These positions are exchanged to form two new offspring.

The objectives of multi-point crossover include increasing genetic diversity in the population, reducing positional bias, and increasing the chances of recombination from various schemas or different solution blocks. However, using too many cut points can become too disruptive, as it can damage already good gene combinations (coadapted alleles).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/buku_ajar_page_25.png}
\caption{Multi-point Crossover for binary chromosomes}
\label{fig:binary_multi_point}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Algorithm}
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Two-Point Crossover}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE Select two random points $k_1, k_2$ where $1 \leq k_1 < k_2 \leq l-1$
\STATE Create offspring:
\STATE $child_1 = parent_1[1:k_1] + parent_2[k_1+1:k_2] + parent_1[k_2+1:l]$
\STATE $child_2 = parent_2[1:k_1] + parent_1[k_1+1:k_2] + parent_2[k_2+1:l]$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Example}
\begin{align}
\text{Parent 1:} &\quad 11|010|011 \\
\text{Parent 2:} &\quad 00|111|100 \\
\text{Child 1:} &\quad 11|111|011 \\
\text{Child 2:} &\quad 00|010|100
\end{align}

Crossover points at positions 2 and 5.

\subsubsection{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduces positional bias
    \item Can preserve building blocks at chromosome ends
    \item More disruptive than one-point crossover
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Uniform Crossover}
Each gene is independently chosen from either parent~\cite{spears1993crossover, eshelman1991chc}.

In uniform crossover, each gene (bit) is randomly selected from one of the corresponding genes on the parent chromosome. This selection process is done independently for each gene position. This method can be analogized to tossing a coin. If the result is "head", the gene is taken from parent 1; if the result is "tail", the gene is taken from parent 2.

This method provides equal opportunity for each gene to be inherited from one of the parents, thereby increasing genetic diversity and eliminating positional bias that typically appears in single-point crossover or multi-point crossover.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/buku_ajar_page_25.png}
\caption{Uniform Crossover for binary chromosomes}
\label{fig:binary_uniform}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Algorithm}
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Uniform Crossover}
\begin{algorithmic}
\FOR{each gene position $i$}
    \STATE Generate random number $r \in [0,1]$
    \IF{$r < 0.5$}
        \STATE $child_1[i] = parent_1[i]$, $child_2[i] = parent_2[i]$
    \ELSE
        \STATE $child_1[i] = parent_2[i]$, $child_2[i] = parent_1[i]$
    \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Example with Mask}
\begin{align}
\text{Parent 1:} &\quad 11010011 \\
\text{Parent 2:} &\quad 00111100 \\
\text{Mask:} &\quad 10110100 \\
\text{Child 1:} &\quad 10111011 \\
\text{Child 2:} &\quad 01010100
\end{align}

Mask bit 1: take from Parent 1, Mask bit 0: take from Parent 2.

\subsubsection{Properties}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maximum disruption potential
    \item No positional bias
    \item Good for problems where gene positions are independent
    \item May destroy long building blocks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-Point Crossover}
Generalization with $k$ crossover points.

\subsubsection{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k = 0$: No crossover (copy parents)
    \item $k = 1$: One-point crossover
    \item $k = l-1$: Uniform crossover (in expectation)
    \item As $k$ increases, approaches uniform crossover
\end{itemize}

\section{Integer Chromosome Crossover}

Unlike binary chromosomes that use bits 0 and 1, integer representation is more suitable for problems involving discrete parameters or numerical values that have quantitative meaning, such as scheduling, sequencing, or combinatorial optimization.

\subsection{Single-Point Crossover for Integer}
Single-Point Crossover is the simplest form of crossover. One crossover position is randomly selected, then the part of the two parents after that position is exchanged to form two new offspring. The strings resulting from this process have Positional Bias characteristics.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/buku_ajar_page_28.png}
\caption{Single-Point Crossover for integer chromosomes}
\label{fig:integer_single_point}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Multi-point Crossover for Integer}
Multi-point crossover has a mechanism like single-point crossover; the difference is the number of randomly selected positions. In Multi-point crossover, a number N of positions are randomly selected along the length of the chromosome. These positions are exchanged to form two new offspring.

The objectives of multi-point crossover include increasing genetic diversity in the population, reducing positional bias, and increasing the chances of recombination from various schemas or different solution blocks. However, using too many cut points can become too disruptive, as it can damage already good gene combinations (coadapted alleles).

\caption{Multi-point Crossover for integer chromosomes}
\label{fig:integer_multi_point}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Uniform Crossover for Integer}
In uniform crossover, each gene is randomly selected from one of the corresponding genes on the parent chromosome. This selection process is done independently for each gene position. This method can be analogized to tossing a coin. If the result is "head", the gene is taken from parent 1; if the result is "tail", the gene is taken from parent 2.

This method provides equal opportunity for each gene to be inherited from one of the parents, thereby increasing genetic diversity and eliminating positional bias that typically appears in single-point crossover or multi-point crossover.

\end{figure}

\section{Real-Valued Crossover Operators}

Crossover on real chromosomes is a genetic recombination process in Genetic Algorithms applied to chromosomes represented in real number form (floating-point representation). This representation is commonly used to solve continuous optimization problems, where decision variables have values within a certain range and are not limited to integers or binary.

Unlike crossover on binary or integer chromosomes, the crossover mechanism for real chromosomes involves arithmetic operations on gene values between parents. This method allows the creation of offspring with gene values that are between or around the parent gene values, thus maintaining the continuity and stability of the evolution process.

\subsection{Arithmetic Crossover}
Linear combination of parent vectors.

\subsubsection{Single Arithmetic Crossover}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two parents are represented as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Parent 1: $\langle x_1, \ldots, x_n \rangle$
        \item Parent 2: $\langle y_1, \ldots, y_n \rangle$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Randomly select one gene ($k$) to undergo crossover operation
    \item The result is two offspring formed based on a linear combination of the $k$-th gene of those parents with control parameter $\alpha$, where $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Offspring 1: $\langle x_1, \ldots, x_{k-1}, \alpha \cdot y_k + (1-\alpha) \cdot x_k, x_{k+1}, \ldots, x_n \rangle$
        \item Offspring 2: $\langle y_1, \ldots, y_{k-1}, \alpha \cdot x_k + (1-\alpha) \cdot y_k, y_{k+1}, \ldots, y_n \rangle$
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Single Arithmetic Crossover for real chromosomes}
\label{fig:real_single_arithmetic}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Simple Arithmetic Crossover}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two parents are represented as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Parent 1: $\langle x_1, \ldots, x_n \rangle$
        \item Parent 2: $\langle y_1, \ldots, y_n \rangle$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Randomly select one gene ($k$) to become the crossover boundary point
    \item The result is two offspring formed based on a linear combination from gene $k+1$ to gene $n$ with control parameter $\alpha$, where $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Offspring 1: $\langle x_1, \ldots, x_k, \alpha \cdot y_{k+1} + (1-\alpha) \cdot x_{k+1}, \ldots, \alpha \cdot y_n + (1-\alpha) \cdot x_n \rangle$
        \item Offspring 2: $\langle y_1, \ldots, y_k, \alpha \cdot x_{k+1} + (1-\alpha) \cdot y_{k+1}, \ldots, \alpha \cdot x_n + (1-\alpha) \cdot y_n \rangle$
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\caption{Simple Arithmetic Crossover for real chromosomes}
\label{fig:real_simple_arithmetic}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Whole Arithmetic Crossover}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two parents are represented as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Parent 1: $\langle x_1, \ldots, x_n \rangle$
        \item Parent 2: $\langle y_1, \ldots, y_n \rangle$
    \end{itemize}
    \item For each gene $i$ ($i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$), offspring are formed with a linear combination of genes from both parents with control parameter $\alpha$, where $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Offspring 1: $z_i^1 = \alpha \cdot y_i + (1-\alpha) \cdot x_i$
        \item Offspring 2: $z_i^2 = \alpha \cdot x_i + (1-\alpha) \cdot y_i$
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/buku_ajar_page_32.png}
\caption{Whole Arithmetic Crossover for real chromosomes}
\label{fig:real_whole_arithmetic}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Whole Arithmetic Crossover}
\begin{align}
\mathbf{child_1} &= \alpha \mathbf{parent_1} + (1-\alpha) \mathbf{parent_2} \\
\mathbf{child_2} &= (1-\alpha) \mathbf{parent_1} + \alpha \mathbf{parent_2}
\end{align}

where $\alpha \in [0,1]$ is a random weight.

\subsubsection{Simple Arithmetic Crossover}
Apply arithmetic crossover to a random subset of genes.

\subsubsection{Single Arithmetic Crossover}
Apply arithmetic crossover to one randomly selected gene.

\subsubsection{Example}
\begin{align}
\text{Parent 1:} &\quad (2.1, 5.7, 1.3, 8.9) \\
\text{Parent 2:} &\quad (4.2, 3.1, 6.8, 2.4) \\
\text{Child 1 ($\alpha=0.3$):} &\quad (3.57, 4.49, 4.98, 4.17) \\
\text{Child 2 ($\alpha=0.3$):} &\quad (2.73, 4.32, 2.98, 6.17)
\end{align}

\subsection{BLX-$\alpha$ Crossover (Blend Crossover)}
Creates offspring in an interval around the parents.

\subsubsection{Algorithm}
For each gene $i$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate $c_{min} = \min(parent_{1i}, parent_{2i})$
    \item Calculate $c_{max} = \max(parent_{1i}, parent_{2i})$
    \item Calculate interval $I = c_{max} - c_{min}$
    \item Generate offspring in $[c_{min} - \alpha \cdot I, c_{max} + \alpha \cdot I]$
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha = 0$: Offspring between parents
    \item $\alpha = 0.5$: Standard BLX-0.5
    \item Larger $\alpha$: More exploration beyond parents
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SBX (Simulated Binary Crossover)}
Simulates the behavior of one-point crossover for real-valued genes.

\subsubsection{Formula}
\begin{align}
child_{1i} &= 0.5[(1+\beta_i)parent_{1i} + (1-\beta_i)parent_{2i}] \\
child_{2i} &= 0.5[(1-\beta_i)parent_{1i} + (1+\beta_i)parent_{2i}]
\end{align}

where $\beta_i$ is calculated from:
\begin{equation}
\beta_i = \begin{cases}
(2u_i)^{1/(\eta_c+1)} & \text{if } u_i \leq 0.5 \\
\left(\frac{1}{2(1-u_i)}\right)^{1/(\eta_c+1)} & \text{if } u_i > 0.5
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

$u_i \sim U[0,1]$ and $\eta_c$ is the distribution index.

\section{Permutation Crossover Operators}

\end{align}

\subsection{Partially Mapped Crossover (PMX)}

\end{align}

\STATE Copy cycle elements from Parent 1
\STATE Copy non-cycle elements from Parent 2
\STATE Create second child by swapping parent roles
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Edge Recombination Crossover}

\subsubsection{Algorithm}
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Edge Recombination}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE Create edge table from both parents
\STATE Start with element having fewest edges
\STATE Add element to offspring
\STATE Remove element from all edge lists
\STATE Move to element with fewest remaining edges
\STATE If tied, choose randomly
\STATE If no edges remain, choose unused element randomly
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Crossover Analysis}

\subsection{Schema Disruption}
The probability that a schema $H$ is disrupted by crossover:

\subsubsection{One-Point Crossover}
\begin{equation}
P_{disruption} = p_c \cdot \frac{\delta(H)}{l-1}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Two-Point Crossover}
\begin{equation}
P_{disruption} = p_c \cdot \left(\frac{2\delta(H)}{l-1} - \frac{\delta(H)(\delta(H)-1)}{(l-1)(l-2)}\right)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Uniform Crossover}
\begin{equation}
P_{disruption} = p_c \cdot \left(1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{o(H)-1}\right)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Building Block Preservation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Short schemas}: Better preserved by all crossover types
    \item \textbf{Long schemas}: More disrupted, especially by uniform crossover
    \item \textbf{Tightly linked}: Order crossover preserves adjacency relationships
\end{itemize}
